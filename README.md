# Upgraded Selection Sort

## About the Project

The Upgraded Selection Sort Project is a program created from my CS-260 class at Southern New Hampshire University that shows the creation and use of
commonly used algorithms such as selection sort, quick sort, and the newly added upgraded selection sort. With the provided CSV file in this repository, the user can perform any
of these sorting algorithms on the created vectors and see the speed output of each in clock ticks and seconds. 

## Motivation

The motivation of this project comes from trying to learn and understand how these algorithms are created, what they are used for, and how their speeds compare starting with 
some of the more basic ones. Learning and understanding algorithms is critical in the computer science field so getting these concepts down by creating this program and later 
upgrading it has been a great help on my journey learning programming. 

## Installation

To install this program, the user must download the files in this repository and create a new project from the downloaded files with the provided source code. The 
eBid_Monthly_Sales_DEc_2016.CSV must also be placed in the root folder where the main.cpp file is located. Once the program is built in C++, the software will run properly.

## Getting Started

Once the project is built in the C++ IDE of your choice, the project should run bringing the user to the main menu displaying the following options:
1. Load Bids
2. Display Bids
3. Selection Sort
4. Upgraded Selection Sort
5. Quick Sort
9. Exit

## Usage

When the program runs, the user is shown a screen giving them the option to load bids, display bids, perform a selection sort, perform an upgraded selection sort, perform a 
quick sort, or exit the program. To begin, start by selecting load bids to load in the elements from the CSV file into a vector. By choosing display bids next, the user 
will be able to see the unsorted elements displayed to the screen. Next, the user can choose which of the sort algorithms they wish to perform, which they can verify by selecting
display bids again right after. To reset the elements and try another sort algorithm, the user can select load bids again, followed by the new sort they wish to use. Again,
the sort can be verified by selecting display bids right after. To exit the program select option 9 at the menu.
